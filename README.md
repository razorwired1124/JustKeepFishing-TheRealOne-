<h2>Problem</h2>
How can members of the fishing community connect with each other and share images?<br/>
How could the app be profitable or appealing to an investor?

<h2>Proposal</h2>
Our application will take a userâ€™s picture and store that picture in a gallery. It will then allow the user to view their pictures and sort them by keyword using a search function that will display the correct image.
The app could be appealing to investors because of the wide market for social media apps, especially photo sharing<br/>
  Easy of use<br/>
  High conversion rate on advertisements due to a community with a shared interest
  
  <h2>Proposel Completion Status</h2>
  All aspects of our proposal have been completed except for the search bar functionality.<br/> 
  Our app does take a picture with your devices camera and stores it in the app's gallery but,<br/>
  you cannot currently search for individual pictures using our search bar.<br/>
  Our search functionality currently takes a list of names and searches through those names displaying the disired item in a toast message once clicked on. 
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
  Easy and simple user interface<br/>
  In app camera access and functionality<br/>
  In app access of the photos folder<br/>
  Automatic gallery updates<br/>
  Photo orginization<br/>
  Search bar<br/>
    Search result narrowing<br/>
    Scrollable result list<br/>
    Automatic picture selection<br/>

<h2>Persistant Data</h2>
Bitmap connecting images to array<br/>
Images stored in camera folder <br/>
Images taken throught the app remain even when app is closed and reopended<br/>
Future implementation may include database with mage storage
  
<h2>Similar Applications</h2>
Instagram<br/>
Fishing Points<br/>
Fishbrain<br/>
Snapchat
  
<h2>Problems Faced</h2>
Picture from camera to gallery (SOLVED)<br/>
Shrinking list to desired items<br/>
Viewing individual pictures in the gallery (SOLVED)
  
<h2>Ideas for future implementation</h2>
Data analysis<br/>
  From user input data when submitting images<br/>
Possible profile and sharing capabilities<br/>
Connection to database<br/>
  All user's data could show trends of fish in bodies of water, good fishing spots, where certian species migrate to in certian season's, where certian fish are more likely to be.<br/>
Connection to other social media apps<br/>
Trandferring images to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.
