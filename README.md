<h2>Problem</h2>
How can members of the fishing community connect with each other and share images?
How could the app be profitable or appealing to an investor?

<h2>Proposal</h2>
Our application will take a userâ€™s picture and store that picture in a gallery. It will then allow the user to view their pictures and sort them by keyword using a search function that will display the correct image.
The app could be appealing to investors because of the wide market for social media apps, especially photo sharing
  Easy of use
  High conversion rate on advertisements due to a community with a shared interest
  
  <h2>Features</h2>

  In app camera access and functionality
  In app access of the photos folder
  Automatic gallery updates
  Photo orginization
  Search bar
    Search result narrowing
    Scrollable result list
    Automatic picture selection 

<h2>Persistant Data</h2>
Bitmap connecting images to array
Images stored in camera folder 
Images taken throught the app remain even when app is closed and reopended
Future implementation may include database with mage storage
